# Applied Learning Project
In all The Linux Foundation courses (in any format) we put a heavy emphasis on learning by doing, and aim for a 50/50 balance between lecture and working on lab exercises. Courses 2, 3 and 4 include numerous lab exercises that give you the opportunity to work in a Linux environment, using the methods and tools presented in lectures.
